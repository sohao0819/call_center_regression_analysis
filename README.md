# Call Center Regression Analysis

The goal of the project is to analyze the call center dataset and make relevant recommendations to the business. 

**Data:**
- leads_name_list.csv. This is a list of company leads, with some basic data about them and their company.
- phone_calls_list.csv. This is a list of calls made by a call centre. The call centre consists of several agents, who make calls one after the other. They donâ€™t get to choose who to call, the system does. The objective of the call is to get the lead to signup on the website. When they finish a call, they mark down the outcome, from a fixed list of possible outcomes. Note that a single lead may be called multiple times.
- signups_list.csv. This is a list of leads who signed up after being called by someone from the call centre. Each signup was risk assessed and either approved or rejected for a loan.
